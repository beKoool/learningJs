# Learning javaScript 👨‍💻
Hello guys, This repository has been made so that I can track my progress of **learning javaScript** from a basic level to a bit of advanced level. I will be pushing all the knowledge that I have on various topics of js with the code that I have written which might be in the form of some fun and interactive projects ✌. 

> `Consistency is more important that perfection ✊`

I will try my best to be consistent on pushing my progress to this repo by making a new project about once a week and also noting down the things that I've learnt in JavaScript so that I can be consistent in learning it.

## Resources

So for learning JavaScript, the resources which I have chosen till now are:

- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/), interactive learning is the best 👍
- [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://freeCodeCamp.org), learn JavaScript for free 😃
- [JavaScript MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), simple but cool 😎
- [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/javascript/), yet another cool docs 👌
- [LearnJSOnline](https://learnjavascript.online/), online but OP ⚡

> **Note**: You can add more **resources** if you want to, by contributing it to this repository in the form of **pull request**. I will surely merge it 😉

## Ending Note

Thank you for viewing this repository 🧡. Feel free to contribute more resources to this repository so that other beginners like us can learn javaScript in an **interactive** way by making new projects timely 😉.

#### Happy Coding! ✌ #InteractiveLearning 😉
