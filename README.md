# Learning javaScript 👨‍💻
Hello guys, This repository has been made so that I can track my progress of **learning javaScript** from a basic level to a bit of advanced level. I will be pushing all the knowledge that I have on various topics of js with the code that I have written which might be in the form of some fun and interactive projects ✌. `#ffffff` 

> `Consistency is more important that perfection ✊`

I will try my best to be consistent on pushing my progress to this repo about once a week so that I can be consistent in learning js which not only helps me to learn quickly but also helps me to be productive in life 😉.

## Resources

So for learning JavaScript, the resources which I have chosen till now are:

- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript/), interactive learning is the best 👍
- [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://freeCodeCamp.org), learn JavaScript for free 😃
- [JavaScript MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), simple but cool 😎
- [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/javascript/), yet another cool docs 👌

> **Note**: You can add more **resources** if you want to, by contributing it to this repository in the form of **pull request**. I will surely merge it 😉

## Projects

I am trying to be consistent in making a new project every week, so for that. The links to the projects is given below:

1. [Week 1 - Guess the number game](https://github.com/TheCoolGDev/learning-js/blob/main/Week%201/Guess%20the%20number)

## Weeks

I will also be keeping the links to my progress and commits of **every week** starting from  Week 1:
